This project implements and compares three RL approaches for Tor multi-hop circuit selection: tabular Q-Learning (baseline), DQN with linear approximation, and A2C with linear approximation. The comparison demonstrates tradeoffs between performance optimization and anonymity-preserving circuit diversity.
